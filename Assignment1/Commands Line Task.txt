1. Create a directory named "cli_assignment".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/Desktop/dir$ mkdir cli_assignment

2. Change the current working directory to the new directory created in the previous
step.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/Desktop/dir$ cd cli_assignment

3. Create a new file named "stuff.txt". Use the touch command to do this. Read about
the touch command using the manual (man) pages.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/Desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ touch stuff.txt

4. Add some text (multiple lines) to this text file using the cat command.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/Desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ cat >> stuff.txt
Here is some text
and also here
and there
and also there 
triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/Desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ cat *stuff.txt //display the texts
Here is some text
and also here
and there

5. Count the number of words and the number of lines in the file "stuff.txt".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/Desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ wc -w stuff.txt
12 stuff.txt

6. Append more text to the file "stuff.txt".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/Desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ cat >> stuff.txt

More added texts
what day is today
more texts
triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/Desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ cat *stuff.txt
Here is some text
and also here
and there
and also there More added texts
what day is today
more texts

7. In the current working directory, create a new directory "draft".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/Desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ mkdir draft

8. Move the "stuff.txt" file to the directory "draft".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ mv -v stuff.txt draft/

9. Change your working directory to "draft" and create a hidden file named "secret.txt".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ cd draft
triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment/draft$ touch .secret.txt

10. Create a new directory ("final") as a copy of the "draft" directory (final should be on
the same level as draft) using the copy command.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ cp -r draft/ final

11. Rename the "draft" directory to "draft.remove". Use the mv command for this.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ mv -v draft draft.remove

12. Move the "draft.remove" directory to inside the "final" directory. Use the mv command for this.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ mv -v draft.remove final

13. From inside the "cli_assignment" directory, list all the files and sub-directories and
their permissions.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ ls -l .
total 0
drwxrwxrwx 1 triplit triplit 4096 Jan 13 11:33 final

14. List the contents of the given file "NASA_access_log_Aug95.gz" without extracting
it. (The file should be on the same level as your "cli_assignment" directory)

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ zmore NASA_access_log_Aug95.gz

15. Extract the given file "NASA_access_log_Aug95.gz".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ gunzip NASA_access_log_Aug95.gz

16. Rename the extracted file to "logs.txt".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ mv NASA_access_log_Aug95 logs.txt

17. Move the file "logs.txt" to the "cli_assignment" directory.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ mv logs.txt final/

18. Read the top 100 lines of the file "logs.txt".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment/final$ head -n 100 logs.txt

19. Create a new file "logs_top_100.txt" containing the top 100 lines using I/O redirection.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment/final$ head -n 100 logs.txt > logs_top_100.txt

20. Read the bottom 100 lines of the file "logs.txt".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment/final$ tail -n 100 logs.txt

21. Create a new file "logs_bottom_100.txt" containing the bottom 100 lines using I/O
redirection.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment/final$ tail -n 100 logs.txt > logs_bottom_10
0.txt

22. Create a new file "logs_snapshot.txt" by concatenating files "logs_top_100.txt" and
"logs_bottom_100.txt".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment/final$ cat logs_top_100.txt logs_bottom_100.
txt > logs_snapshot.txt

23. Now append to the "logs_snapshot.txt" the line "asurite: This is a great assignment"
and the current date (asurite is your asurite, e.g. amehlhas for me)

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment/final$ echo jcnguye: This is a great assignm
ent 1/13/2023 >> logs_snapshot.txt

24. Read the file "logs.txt" using the less command.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment/final$ less logs.txt

25. Using the given file "marks.csv" (delimited by %), print the column "student_names"
without the header (you can use the column num as index). Use the cut command
and I/O redirection. (This file should be on the same level as your "cli_assignment"
directory)

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir$ cut -d% -f1 marks.csv

26. Using the given file "marks.csv", print the sorted list of marks in "subject_3". Use
the sort command piped with the cut command.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir$ cut -d% -f3 marks.csv | sort -n > sorted_marks.txt

27. Using the given file "marks.csv", print the average marks for "subject_2" (it is ok to
us awk).

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir$ awk -F% '{sum += $2; count++} END {print sum/count}' marks.csv

28. Save the average into a new file "done.txt" inside of the "cli_assignment" directory.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir$ awk -F% '{sum += $2; count++} END {print sum/count}' marks.csv > done.txt

29. Move "done.txt" into your "final" directory.

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment$ mv done.txt final

30. Rename the "done.txt" file to "average.txt".

triplit@LAPTOP-GNHUPECB:/mnt/c/Users/nguye/desktop/dir/cli_assignment/final$ mv done.txt average.txt
