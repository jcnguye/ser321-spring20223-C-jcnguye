# GRPC Services and Registry

The following folder contains a Registry.jar which includes a Registering service where Nodes can register to allow clients to find them and use their implemented GRPC services. 

Some more detailed explanations will follow and please also check the build.gradle file

Before starting do a "gradle generateProto".

Fully implemented the Hometown service along with the zodiac service to run description below.

### gradle runRegistryServer
Will run the Registry node on localhost (arguments are possible see gradle). This node will run and allows nodes to register themselves. 

The Server allows Protobuf, JSON and gRPC. We will only be using gRPC

### gradle runNode
#### Default node has been given call runNode
Will run a node with an Echo, joke, hometown, and zodiac service. The node registers itself on the Registry. You can change the host and port the node runs on and this will register accordingly with the Registry

### gradle runClient

#### To runClient runClient -Phost=localhost -Pport=8000 -Pauto=1
##### this will automatically tests the home implementation and the zodiac implementation

Will run a client which will call the services from the node, it talks to the node directly not through the registry. At the end the client does some calls to the Registry to pull the services, this will be needed later.

### gradle runDiscovery
Will create a couple of threads with each running a node with services in JSON and Protobuf. This is just an example and not needed for assignment 6. 

### gradle testProtobufRegistration
Registers the protobuf nodes from runDiscovery and do some calls. 

### gradle testJSONRegistration
Registers the json nodes from runDiscovery and do some calls.
